- **abstract**:Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressing neurodegenerative disease with early manifestation of motor signs. Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing automatic tools that can assess motor function in PD patients. Here we show that mouse tracking data collected during people's interaction with a search engine can be used to distinguish PD patients from similar, non-diseased users and present a methodology developed for the diagnosis of PD from these data. The main challenge we address is the extraction of informative features from raw mouse tracking data. We do so in two complementary ways: First, we manually construct expert-recommended features, aiming to identify abnormalities in motor behaviors. Second, we use an unsupervised representation learning technique to map these raw data to high-level features. Using all the extracted features, a Random Forest classifier is then used to distinguish PD patients from controls, achieving an AUC of 0.92, while results using only expert-generated or auto-generated features are 0.87 and 0.83, respectively. Our results indicate that mouse tracking data can help in detecting users at early stages of the disease and that both expert-generated features and unsupervised techniques for feature generation are required to achieve the best possible performance.
