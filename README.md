# Awesome Knowledge Graph Publications

The initial outline of this repository was primarily based the **comprehensive introduction to knowledge graphs** by [Hogan, A. et al, 02 July 2021, ACM Computing Surveys, 54(4): 1–37](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447772) as well as that introduction's [companion examples on GitHub](https://github.com/knowledge-graphs-tutorial/examples).

## Terminology

### Knowledge Graph 

The exact [definition of a “*knowledge graph*"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02320) was probably always bound to be contentious, since the phrase “knowledge graph” has been used to evoke a hazily juxtaposed idea linking "knowledge" and "graphs" in the technical literature since at least 1972, but the modern popularized incarnation of the phrase in common industry parlance seems to stem from the 2012 announcement of the Google Knowledge Graph echoed by the follow-on announcements of the development of *"we did that here, too"* knowledge graphs by Airbnb, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, IBM, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Uber, and more besides. Even though its use might have been spurred by hype and evangelizers, the growing industrial uptake of the concept proved difficult for academia to ignore. More and more scientific literature is being published on knowledge graphs, which includes books as well as papers outlining definitions, novel techniques, and surveys of specific aspects of knowledge graphs.







### Related Tertiary Literature

A number of related surveys, books, and so on, have been published relating to knowledge graphs as tertiary literature—surveys, books, tutorials, andso on relating to knowledge graphs. Some of the related literature provides more detail on particular topics that are not particularly focused on knowledge graphs, familiarity with topics is useful as further background reading ... the primary focus of this curated list of publications is to provide a broad and accessible introduction to the specific topic of knowledge graphs.
